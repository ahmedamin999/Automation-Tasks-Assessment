## Task 3: Python
### Introduction
According to the requirements in task 3, I had to use a library that analyzes data sets. After searching, **"Pandas"** was the best library to do this task because It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data.

### Code Details:

''' import pandas as pd ''' 

in Task 3 i have import and export CVS file from a local path in my PC but we can also export it from a GitHub link instead
